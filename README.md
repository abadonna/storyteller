# Text Adventure
Game engine for text adventures, similar to TADS (http://www.tads.org).
This type of games is a bit "outdated" nowadays, but such games can match modern messengers pretty good.

## Discord markup
You can use additional commands in text to be parsed by discord bot:
* [[img=url]] - add image to response
* [[break]] - split response

## How to use
See sample game.
